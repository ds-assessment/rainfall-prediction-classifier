## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether it will rain **tomorrow** in the Melbourne region using historical weather observations.  
Key steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (e.g., Season from Date)  
- Handling categorical and numeric variables with pipelines  
- Model training and evaluation (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
- Performance comparison and interpretation of feature importance
